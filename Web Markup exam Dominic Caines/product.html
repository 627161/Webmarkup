				<h1><em>The Story</em></h1>
					<p>
						Nike Dri-FIT is an innovative polyester microfiber designed with sweat-wicking technology 
						that keeps you cool and dry. Nike designed Dri-FIT to be lightweight, breathable and to stretch & move 
						with your body, so you can compete and train longer without your clothing slowing you down.

				<h1><em>The Problem</em></h1>
					<p>
						Nike Dri-FIT was created to maximize training and performance through a breathable & innovative 
						sports apparel. The technical fabric was an instant success and has sustained its legacy decades 
						later as one of the more prominent types of clothing for athletes and active lifestyles.

				<h1><em>The Uses</em></h1>
					<p>
						It's as easy as puttting it on. Instead of trapping sweat and moisture in the garment, Dri-FIT pushes 
						sweat away from the body and onto its surface, where it is then evaporated. The result is a dry and comfortable 
						feeling that allows for a free range of motion. Nike Dri-FIT can be worn in any climate, but it works best as a 
						single layer or a base layer under other layers. The closer to the body, the better Dri-FIT works to wick away sweat or retain heat.

				<h1><em>The consumer</em></h1>
					<p>
						Dri-Fit is for everyone. Dri-FIT is the ultimate solution for anyone who wants to stay cool and dry in a variety of situations.
						Whether an NFL football player or just a running enthusiast who hits the pavement near your home, Nike Dri-FIT technology fabrics 
						can help you go harder, longer and faster in comfort.

				<h1><em>The company</em></h1>
					<p>
						What you can expect from a company like Nike is engagment. Nike has given their customers a reason to want to come back to 
						their website every day and engage -  engage with Nike, engage with their friends. Everyone gets added value: the customers 
						get something that helps them with their fitness regime and helps them interact with friends, while Nike gets valuable information
						about how customers are using its products.

				<h1><em>The future</em></h1>
					<p>
						Dri fit is a high-performance, microfiber, polyester fabric created in the early 2000s. That moves sweat away from the body and to the fabric surface, where it evaporates. 
						Which is different from fabrics such as cotton that absorbs sweat and holds it in. The material has been the top pick for athletes since its release. Though it isnâ€™t as comfortable 
						and soft as other fabrics it is more resistant and built for sports driven activities. As a result, Dri-FIT keeps athletes dry and comfortable. So because it's been around 
						for as long as it has and it's still used by most athletes the future of Dri Fit still seems stable.
